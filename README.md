# Curriculum Vitae

## Education			        		
**BS, Honors Biology | McGill University (2019-2023)**
  - Graduated with First Class Honors
  - Honors Thesis: *Exploring Trametinib Resistance in Lung Adenocarcinoma: What Ablated Kinases Could Function Synergistically with MEK1/2 Inhibition to Prevent Cancer Recurrence.*

### Research Experience
**Postbaccalaureate Research Fellow in Brownell Lab at the National Institutes of Health (_May 2023 - Present_)**
- As the group's mouse colony manager, I validate and conserve the genetic makeup and phenotypes of hundreds of mice spanning 50 genetic strains. I am also working to create a mouse model of Merkel cell carcinoma.
- Concurrently, I also work on other research projects that bridge the gap between the bench and the clinic. These include exploring how the immune system can precipitate spontaneous regression in Merkel cell carcinoma, investigating the role of Gfi1 in Merkel cell differentiation, and drafting dermatology case reports.

**Honors Undergraduate Researcher in Dankort Lab at McGill University (_September 2023 - April 2023_)**
- My project aimed to uncover ablated kinases that resensitize drug-resistant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAC) cells to trametinib, a MEK inhibitor drug.
- This involved conducting a kinase-targeting CRISPR screen on mouse-derived, trametinib-resistant LUAC cells with p53 loss and oncogenic Kras or Braf mutations.

**Research Assistant in Lu Lab at Harvard School of Public Health Undergraduate Researcher in Dankort Lab at McGill University (_September 2023 - April 2023_)**
