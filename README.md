# Curriculum Vitae

## Education			        		
**BS, Honors Biology | McGill University (2019-2023)**
  - Graduated with **First Class Honors**
  - Honors Thesis: *Exploring Trametinib Resistance in Lung Adenocarcinoma: What Ablated Kinases Could Function Synergistically with MEK1/2 Inhibition to Prevent Cancer Recurrence?*

## Research Experience
**National Institutes of Health:**  

*Postbaccalaureate Research Fellow - Brownell Lab (May 2023 - Present)*
- As the group's mouse colony manager, I validate and conserve the genetic makeup and phenotypes of hundreds of mice spanning 50 genetic strains. I am also working to create a **mouse model of Merkel cell carcinoma**.
- Concurrently, I also work on other research projects that bridge the gap between the bench and the clinic. These include exploring how the immune system can precipitate **spontaneous regression** in Merkel cell carcinoma, investigating the role of Gfi1 in **Merkel cell differentiation**, and drafting dermatology case reports.

**McGill University:**  

*Honors Undergraduate Researcher - Dankort Lab (September 2022 - April 2023)*
- My project aimed to uncover ablated kinases that **resensitize drug-resistant lung adenocarcinoma** (LUAC) cells to trametinib, a MEK inhibitor drug.
- This involved conducting a kinase-targeting **CRISPR screen** on mouse-derived, trametinib-resistant LUAC cells with p53 loss and oncogenic Kras or Braf mutations.

**Harvard School of Public Health:**  

*Research Assistant - Lu Lab (July 2022)*
- Prepared **ARRDC1-mediated microvesicles** (ARMMs) by transfecting HEK293 cells with a plasmid containing a shortened ARRDC1-Cas9 fusion protein targeting the GFP gene.
- After collecting and quantifying the microvesicles, recipient U2OS-GFP cells were treated with the ARMMs.
- Genome editing efficacy was determined via flow cytometry and sequencing; the use of these ARMMs resulted in a decrease in GFP-positive cells, **demonstrating that gene editing occurred**.

**Harvard School of Public Health:**  

*Research Assistant - Lin Lab (May - June 2022)*
- Assisted with the development of **FAVOR** (Functional Annotation of Variants Online Resource), which gathers, outlines, and visualizes functional annotation data.
- Employed Python, R, and the command line to create a **back-end functional annotation database** for the GRCh37 / hg19 reference genome.
- Optimized database code to prioritize efficient memory consumption and low computing time; this process included correcting memory leaks and implementing techniques such as lazy loading and sparse data structures.
